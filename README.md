### Analyzing the performance of trees

> You are an expert software engineer and site reliablity engineer that puts code into production in large scale systems.

> I have an implementation of a binary search tree here - please analyze it and let me know what I would need to do to trust this in a production environment, particularly from a security perspective.

> Also, is there anything missing I should add?

---

> Can you update the code to fix all of security considerations, while also adding the functional enhancement?

> Please, thoroughly document this code line by line to explain what each line does. Be very detailed, in particular for the recursive and threaded parts
