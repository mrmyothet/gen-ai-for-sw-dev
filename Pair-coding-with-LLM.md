### Prompt generating code

> Can you write a python function to add two numbers named 'a' and 'b' and return the result?

> Create a JavaScript function that adds two numbers.

> Write a C# method to add two numbers.

> write a python function using numpy to add two arrays

### Interactive codding

> Write a Javascript function to check if a number is prime.

> Update the function to include error handling for non-integer and non-positive inputs.

> Can you help me create a simple Flask application in Python that includes one API endpoint? This endpoint should handle GET requests at the URL /multiply, which accepts two query parameters a and b and returns the multiplication of these two parameters as a JSON response. Make sure to include error handling if the parameters are not provided or if they are not convertible to integers.

> Help me find errors in this code:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):

    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    count = len(numbers)
    average = total_sum / count
    return average
```

> Please, write a python function named calculate_area that takes an argument radius. The function should calculate the area of a circle given the radius. Ensure that the function handles non-numeric inputs by raising a ValueError with the message 'Input must be a numeric value.'. Include comments in the code explaining each step.

### Iterative Prompting

> write a python function using the requests library to download a file from a URL and save the file to disk without using third-party libraries like wget.

> Create a REST API in flask to return user data

> Now add error handling to the API to handle 404 and 500 status codes

> please, add detailed comments that explain this code. Highlight any complex parts that might require deeper explaination.
